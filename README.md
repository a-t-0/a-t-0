Hi there✨!
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with [Hiveminds](https://github.com/hiveminds) and [TruCol](https://trucol.io/protocol/)
- :rocket: I'm currently focussed on improving repo quality ➡️ people come into a clean environment when they want to ride the wave 🏄! 
  - [Spin up a GitLab server with a continuous integration runner](https://github.com/Simple-Setup/Self-host-GitLab-Server-and-Runner-CI), put build status badges on all your GitHub repositiories :white_check_mark:

- 💬 If you like the work I do, feel free to support me:
